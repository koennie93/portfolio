title: Battleship Snapchat
description: A modern take on the classic Battleship game created by Coolgames for the Snapchat platform. Played directly within Snapchat’s messaging interface, users could challenge friends or be matched with random opponents in a turn-based battle of wits. The core gameplay stayed true to the original; each player secretly placed a fleet of ships on a grid and took turns guessing where their opponent’s ships were hidden, aiming to sink them all. What made this version stand out was its integration with Snapchat’s social features and the addition of strategic power-ups. Players could use tools like the Air Raid to cover wide areas, Torpedo Strikes to target entire rows or columns, and Sonar Pulses to scan sections of the board—introducing fresh tactical depth. Designed with vibrant visuals and smooth animations, the game was quick, accessible, and engaging, capturing the attention of Snapchat’s younger user base. Notifications kept the pace casual but competitive, allowing friends to battle it out over time while staying connected through chat.
